fstore - a very simplistic file and note storage server with a command line
client and a web interface for editing and drag & drop upload.

INSTALLATION

- Requires: Python with flask, requests.
- Create credentials.py with two variables, USER and PASSWORD, for access.
- Run fstore.py to spawn a server.
- Make sure ./credentials.json and ./data are writeable for fstore.py.


A WORD ON SECURITY

I regard this as an experiment, not as production ready code. Please audit
it if you intend to run it somewhere where it is publicly available. (And
kindly let me know what you find ðŸ˜ƒ)


See also ../zshrc/site/_fs for shell completion.
