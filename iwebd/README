iwebd - Instant web daemons

The idea of this project is to provide people with network daemons for development
purposes and ad-hoc use. If you need an httpd, simply run
 ihttpd <port>
and you'll have one.

Currently, this project consists of:

* ihttpd - An instant httpd
  
  Features:
   * CGI
   * Keep-Alive
   * Range'd requests
   * Scalability (does not use threads or multiple processes, relies on select() instead)
   * mod_rewrite support (does not support RewriteCond; only used for otherwise non-existant files)
   * Uses icons from XDG icon theme in directory listings, if X and pygtk are available

  ihttpd only supports a subset of HTTP 1.1

* iftpd - An instant ftpd

  Features:
   * Authentication
   * Read and write support
   * Announces itself to the local network via Avahi
   * Nearly full ftp protocol support

* cihttpd - A C implementation of the instant httpd

  YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS. THIS IS MORE OF A FUN PROJECT THAN ANYTHING OF
  ACTUAL USE. There are lots of tiny C httpds around, which could easily be
  hacked to serve from the current directory. See for example my scripts
  repository for a wrapper around lighttpd.

  Features:
   * Keep-Alive
   * Range'd requests
   * mod_rewrite (does not support RewriteCond, as above)
   * Thread-based

* megad - Monolithic version of all python daemons above

  Still in development. The goal is to eventually kill this repository and move
  this to the scripts repository.
