This is a collection of scripts I use in my everyday live. They are very useful
to me, but I don't consider them interesting enough to maintain them in
individual repositories. 

I mainly put this up here so that I can easily move into new computers' $HOMEs.
Don't expect too much documentation. But feel free to contact me if you have
any questions.

Unless stated otherwise in specific files, everything within this repository is
released under the terms of the GNU Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>.



Contents:

* gdo

  find(1)-like utility with support for
   
      find -regextype pcre -iregex "$1" -exec "$2" \;

  but (a) this really works with pcre, (b) more comfortable:

      gdo regex +anotherregex <command>

  use $.. or %.. to backreference in the command.


* passwrd

  Meant to be bound to a hotkey. Searches for the active window's title,
  decrypts a secret password file, searches for the correct password and enters
  it automatically.

  You'll need to use gpg-agent for this to work. No support for
  passphrase-input-windows


* runGraphical

  Yet another program starter for X11. Define shortcuts and execute the
  commands easily. For example, put

      o opera

  in the configuration file and start the program. Now you'll only need to hit
  "o", and opera will start.


* todo

  Tiny todo file management with support for annotations like due date,
  priorities and multiple hosts.
 

* unpack

  Generic unpacker for a variety of formats. Takes care of not messing up your
  $PWD. Can download files for you.


* zshrc

  My .zshrc (actually, ~/.zsh directory)


* conky_and_bg

  My conky configuration, worker scripts and a hilariousâ„¢ script which
  automatically changes your desktop image by a random choice from a
  backgrounds directory - with support for dual screen setups and automatic
  ImageMagick invocation to draw a semi-transparent box at the right edge of
  the screen. Where conky resides. For X11 setups without RGBA extension, where
  conky can not do this by itself.


* httpd

  I'm sometimes in need of an ad-hoc httpd, but not a toy one like my ihttpd,
  but one which can actually handle real-world-situations. This wrapper script
  runs lighttpd, in the same fashion as my ihttpd: Serving from ./, with
  support for PHP.

* iwebd

  Monolithic instantaneous httpd and ftpd with support for everything you'd ever
  need to quickly move a from b to c. Including webdav.

* nonroot_apt

  1) A script for Debian based systems which allows non-root users to install
     missing packages into their own $PREFIXes. It basically invokes apt-get to
     get the URLs to the package and its dependencies and then downloads all
     the files and unpacks them whereever the user wants them. Includes basic
     tracking for already satisfied dependencies.
  2) A script to copy already installed packages and all their dependencies
     into a given directory. Useful to set up chroots.
  3) A script to use apt repositories from non-Debian distributions

* venv
  
  A tool to setup virtual environments for more than just python. Also contains
  a library which hooks into getpwent and replaces the home-directory with
  $HOME - this is required in GTK apps since GTK ignores $HOME and uses passwd
  entries instead.

* lock

  A very simple X11 locking app. Screen blanking & PAM authentication only.

* pydoce

  A tool to open python source code in an editor, not by specifying the file
  name, but instead the pythonic path to a definition (i.e. os.path.isdir).

* livereload

  An implementation of a livereload server backend. I know that tons of
  ruby/node.js tools serve the same purpose, however, I wanted something
  that is small and works out of the box on my PCs. (Which usually have
  Python installed, but neither ruby nor node.)
