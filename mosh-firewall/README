This is a wrapper for mosh-server that opens a port in the firewall for the
mosh connection.

Note: 

This program has two security relevant race conditions. It uses kill (signal 0) to
check if mosh is still running in 2 second intervals. Another process might start
right after mosh quit and reuse the pid. This program would not realize this.
Also, since it only checks every 2 seconds, another program might reuse the port
mosh-server used right after mosh quit. Since most setups contain a conntrack rule
that allows existing connections to continue, any connection opened within this
two second window would persist.

On Linux, the first issue is mitigated by using the Netlink interface to procfs
to monitor the process. The second still exists, but the window for opening
another connection is considerably shorter.

To install:

dpkg-divert --add --rename --divert /usr/bin/mosh-server-real /usr/bin/mosh-server
gcc -std=c99 -o /usr/bin/mosh-server mosh-server-firewall.c
chown root:root /usr/bin/mosh-server
chmod u+s /usr/bin/mosh-server
